		<p style="text-align:justify;"><font size="+2">Hours after the Dixie Wildfire, the largest wildfire in California history, engulfed the small Sierra Nevada village of Greenville, the main road of the historic gold rush town was reduced to smoldering ruins. Nearly one-fifth of the town of Greenville engulfed by the Dixie wildfires burned overnight, and the blaze is so large that it has created its own weather system. "The Dixie Fire has destroyed our entire downtown area," Plumas County Counselor Kevin Goss wrote on Facebook Thursday. "Our historic buildings, family homes, small businesses And the children's schools are all gone." Environmental impact of the Dixie Fire: The Dixie Fire is part of the global warming climate crisis that is bringing extreme heat and worrying droughts to the region. The smoke produced during the burning rises into the hazy sky, causing air pollution and affecting people's normal life. </font size></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><font size="+2">Miyako was destroyed by a tsunami triggered by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake on March 11, 2011. From the town's 960 ship fishing fleet, just 30–60 boats survived. The waters had reached at least 37.9 metres (124 feet) above sea level, according to a field survey conducted by the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute, almost matching the 38.2 metres (125 feet) record set by the tsunami caused by the 1896 Sanriku earthquake. The total death toll from the tragedy was 420 confirmed dead, 92 missing, and 4,005 houses damaged, according to the latest reports.</font size></p>
		<p style="text-align:justify;"><font size="+2">Miyako provided some of the most memorable tsunami imagery, which was constantly shown throughout the world. It depicts a dark black wave cresting and overflowing a floodwall, throwing automobiles, then a fishing ship capsizing as it hits a submerged floodwall and finally being crushed as it is driven beneath a bridge.</font size></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><font size="+2">On November 11, 1970, the Bhola cyclone hit East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and India's West Bengal, causing widespread devastation. It is still the deadliest tropical cyclone in history and one of the deadliest natural disasters on the planet. At least 500,000 people died as a consequence of the storm, mostly as a result of the storm surge that swamped much of the Ganges Delta's low-lying islands.  Bhola was the sixth and most powerful cyclone of the 1970 cyclone season in the North Indian Ocean.</font size></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><font size="+2">On April 26, 1989, the Daulatpur–Saturia tornado struck Bangladesh's Manikganj District. It was Bangladesh's worst tornado in its history. The death toll is unknown, although estimates suggest it was catastrophic, killing over 1,300 people, making it the worst tornado in history. The tornado had the largest impact in Daulatpur and Saturia, travelling east through Daulatpur and then northeast into Saturia. The tornado impacted a region that had been in a condition of drought for the previous six months. </font size></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><font size="+2">The Vargas catastrophe happened in Vargas State, Venezuela, on the 14–16 December 1999, when severe rains created flash floods and debris flows that killed tens of thousands of people, damaged thousands of houses, and caused the state's infrastructure to completely collapse. According to aid personnel, the Los Corales community was buried under 3 metres (9.8 feet) of mud, with a large number of homes being pushed into the ocean. Cerro Grande and Carmen de Uria, for example, were entirely destroyed. During the catastrophe, up to ten percent of Vargas' population died.<font size="+2"></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><font size="+2"> While Hurricane Allen in 1980 had the highest barometric pressure, Hurricane Harvey in 2017 had the most number of fatalities and damages, costing Texas $125 billion. Hurricane Allen, which hit the state in August 1980, was the first storm of the era, while Hurricane Harvey, which hit the state on August 25, 2017, was the most recent. Hurricane Harvey produced maximum sustained winds comparable to Category 4 classification on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, making it the strongest storm to hit the state since 1980 in terms of wind speed. </font size></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><font size="+2">Flooding was triggered by torrential rain in a number of villages and cities in Kerman's southeastern province. Southern Roodbar in Kerman Province is one of the hardest-hit cities, with residences and public spaces flooded after severe rains. Hormozgan province has also had to evacuate residents from numerous flooded villages due to heavy rain. Flooding has wreaked havoc on houses and agricultural fields in the towns of Minab and Rodan, with the towns of Minab and Rodan bearing the brunt of the tragedy. Many nearby roads have also been shut down. Because many homes, agricultural areas, and trees have been drowned, people may only pass through certain settlements by boat. Meanwhile, rain and snow clogged certain highways in the northwest and western regions. Flooding, blizzards, and snowfall caused dozens of highways to be closed. Maintenance crews are attempting to clear the blocked roadways.</font size></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Drought is a protracted period of dry weather that may occur everywhere on the planet as part of the natural climate cycle. It's a gradual onset phenomena brought on by a lack of rain. Drought susceptibility is exacerbated by variables such as poverty and unsuitable land use.<font size="+2"></font size></p>
