			<p style="text-align:justify;"><font size="+2">Natural disasters include firestorms, duststorms, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, and other geologic processes. A natural catastrophe can result in the loss of life or property, as well as economic harm, the severity of which is determined by the resilience of the affected people and the infrastructure available.</font size></p>
			<p style="text-align:justify;"><font size="+2">The distinction between natural, man-made, and man-accelerated is becoming increasingly difficult to draw in modern times, with human decisions such as design, fire, resource management, and even climate change all possibly having a part. If an unfavourable occurrence occurs in a region where there are no vulnerable people, it will not be considered a catastrophe. An unfavourable occurrence in a susceptible place, such as Nepal after the 2015 earthquake, can have severe results and create long-term damage that can take years to heal. The devastating results have an influence on impacted populations' mental health, frequently leading to post-traumatic symptoms. Collective processing can help to sustain these enhanced emotional experiences, resulting in improved resilience and community participation.</font size></p>
